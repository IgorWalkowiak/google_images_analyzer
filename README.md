# google_images_analyzer
Program which download autonomusly images from google and based on them learns how to recognize them. 

Used: Keras, google_images_download, cv2, numpy

It's just a training app. I realized that google images without human help is very poor source of images. It downloads some random photos and it breaks neural network.
